# Student Grade Calculator

This project was assigned via *freeCodeCamp* as part of an exercise to practice JavaScript functions, conditional statements, and string concatenation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

1. Calculate the average score of a class based on an array of test scores.
2. Convert a student's score into a letter grade.
3. Check if a student has a passing grade.
4. Generate a message to inform the student whether they passed or failed the course, along with their grade and the class average.

## Files

- *stepFour.js*: This file contains the completed program, including all the required functions (`getAverage`, `getGrade`, `hasPassingGrade`, and `studentMsg`) to fulfill the project requirements.

## Usage

To run the program, simply call the functions in `stepFour.js` with the appropriate arguments, such as a list of student scores and a student's individual score. The program will calculate the class average, determine the student's grade, and return a message indicating whether the student passed or failed.

## Example Output

Class average: 90. Your grade: B. You passed the course.
